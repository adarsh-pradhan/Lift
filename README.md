# Lift
A simple program for practicing Python.
The code consists of "if-else" statements and "random" module.

Input any integer, and it will search for a suitable lift for you.

It selects the lift closest to your current floor. For lesser waiting time and energy.
It also check whether the weight limit has already exceeded before selecting one.


Current number of lifts: 3

#PS :Will be adding more number of lifts in future
